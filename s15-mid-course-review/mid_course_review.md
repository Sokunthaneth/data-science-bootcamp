## Data Types

1. **Which of the following is an example of a categorical data type?**  
   a) Customer age in years  
   b) Product price in dollars  
   c) Customer satisfaction rating (e.g., "satisfied," "neutral," "dissatisfied")  
   d) Daily website traffic count  

   **Correct Answer**: c) Customer satisfaction rating (e.g., "satisfied," "neutral," "dissatisfied")  
   **Explanation**: Categorical data consists of discrete, non-numerical values, like satisfaction ratings. In practice, encoding categorical data (e.g., one-hot encoding) is crucial for models like logistic regression in customer feedback analysis, enabling predictive insights.

2. **What is the key difference between numerical and categorical data in data science?**  
   a) Numerical data is always more accurate than categorical data  
   b) Numerical data represents quantities, while categorical data represents labels or groups  
   c) Categorical data is used only in unsupervised learning  
   d) Numerical data cannot be visualized  

   **Correct Answer**: b) Numerical data represents quantities, while categorical data represents labels or groups  
   **Explanation**: Numerical data (e.g., height) is measurable, while categorical data (e.g., gender) represents categories. Understanding this distinction helps in selecting appropriate models, like using numerical data for regression or categorical data for classification in real-world tasks like market analysis.

   b) Ensuring data is collected from a single source to avoid complexity  
   c) Defining clear objectives to guide relevant data collection  
   d) Collecting data as quickly as possible to start analysis  

   **Correct Answer**: c) Defining clear objectives to guide relevant data collection  
   **Explanation**: Clear objectives ensure that the collected data aligns with the project's goals, reducing noise and irrelevant features. For example, if analyzing customer churn, you need data on user behavior, not unrelated metrics like weather. This focus improves model accuracy and efficiency in real-world applications like marketing analytics.

7. **Which method is most appropriate for collecting real-time user feedback on a website?**  
   a) Web scraping public forums  
   b) Conducting in-person interviews  
   c) Deploying an online survey with a pop-up form  
   d) Analyzing historical sales data  

   **Correct Answer**: c) Deploying an online survey with a pop-up form  
   **Explanation**: Online surveys collect real-time feedback directly from users interacting with the website, making them ideal for capturing current sentiments. For instance, e-commerce sites use pop-up surveys to gauge user satisfaction, enabling immediate improvements to user experience.

8. **What is a common challenge in data collection that can introduce bias?**  
   a) Using automated data logging tools  
   b) Collecting data from a non-representative sample  
   c) Storing data in a structured database  
   d) Cleaning data before analysis

10. **Which visualization is best for identifying the distribution of a continuous variable like income?**  
    a) Bar chart  
    b) Scatter plot  
    c) Histogram  
    d) Pie chart  

    **Correct Answer**: c) Histogram  
    **Explanation**: A histogram shows the frequency distribution of a continuous variable, making it ideal for understanding income ranges. In practice, a retailer might use a histogram to identify common customer income brackets, informing pricing strategies.

11. **What does a high correlation coefficient (e.g., 0.9) between two variables indicate?**  
    a) One variable causes the other  
    b) The variables have a strong linear relationship  
    c) The variables are independent  
    d) The variables are categorical  

    **Correct Answer**: b) The variables have a strong linear relationship  
    **Explanation**: A correlation coefficient near 1 indicates a strong linear relationship, useful for feature selection in models like regression. For instance, in real estate, a high correlation between house size and price can guide predictive modeling, though correlation does not imply causation.

12. **When performing EDA, what should you do if you find missing values in a dataset?**  
    a) Ignore them and proceed with modeling  
    b) Drop all rows with missing values  
    c) Investigate patterns and consider imputation or removal  
    d) Replace all missing values with zeros  

    **Correct Answer**: c) Investigate patterns and consider imputation or removal  
    **Explanation**: Investigating missing values helps determine if they are random or systematic, guiding whether to impute (e.g., with mean/median) or remove them. For example, in healthcare data, missing blood pressure readings might indicate non-compliance, affecting how you handle them in analysis.

    d) To cluster users into similar groups  

    **Correct Answer**: b) To compare two versions of a variable to determine which performs better  
    **Explanation**: A/B testing compares two variants (e.g., website designs) to measure impact on metrics like click-through rates. For example, an e-commerce site might test two checkout button colors to optimize conversions, a common real-world application.

14. **What is a key assumption in A/B testing to ensure valid results?**  
    a) The sample size is small to reduce costs  
    b) The test groups are randomly assigned  
    c) All users see both variants simultaneously  
    d) The test runs for only one day  

    **Correct Answer**: b) The test groups are randomly assigned  
    **Explanation**: Random assignment ensures groups are comparable, minimizing bias. For instance, in testing ad campaigns, randomizing user exposure prevents skewed results due to demographic differences, ensuring reliable conclusions.

15. **What metric is commonly used to determine the success of an A/B test?**  
    a) Mean absolute error  
    b) Statistical significance (p-value)  
    c) R-squared value  
    d) Silhouette score  

    **Correct Answer**: b) Statistical significance (p-value)  
    **Explanation**: The p-value assesses whether the observed difference between groups is statistically significant. In practice, a low p-value (e.g., <0.05) in an A/B test for email open rates confirms that one email design outperforms another reliably.

17. **Which technique is used to remove trends and seasonality from time series data?**  
    a) Normalization  
    b) Differencing  
    c) One-hot encoding  
    d) Principal component analysis  

    **Correct Answer**: b) Differencing  
    **Explanation**: Differencing subtracts consecutive observations to make a time series stationary, aiding models like ARIMA. For example, differencing monthly sales data can remove seasonal trends, improving forecast accuracy in inventory management.

18. **What is a common application of time series forecasting?**  
    a) Customer segmentation  
    b) Predicting stock prices  
    c) Image classification

    d) The number of iterations in training  

    **Correct Answer**: b) The proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model  
    **Explanation**: R-squared measures how well the model fits the data. For example, an R-squared of 0.8 in a sales prediction model indicates 80% of sales variance is explained by features like advertising spend.

21. **When might linear regression perform poorly?**  
    a) When the data has a strong linear relationship  
    b) When there are no outliers in the data  
    c) When the relationship between variables is highly non-linear  
    d) When the dataset is large  

    **Correct Answer**: c) When the relationship between variables is highly non-linear  
    **Explanation**: Linear regression struggles with non-linear relationships, like predicting demand that follows a quadratic pattern. In such cases, alternative models like polynomial regression are used in practice.
